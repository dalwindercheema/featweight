# MATLAB Source Code for Feature Weighting with Ant Lion optimization

In this code Ant Lion optimization is used to search the feature weights along with the optimal value of nearest neighbor parameter (i.e. k) simultaneously.

Run Main.m file for demo.

The feature weighting with ALO is implemented in FW_ALO.m file. Check this file for more details.
