# Source Code for Feature Weighting with Ant Lion optimization

This aims to search for the feature weights with the optimal value of nearest neighbor parameter (i.e. k) simultaneously.

Run Main.m file for demo.

The feature weighting with ALO is implemented in FW_ALO.m file. Check this file for more details.
